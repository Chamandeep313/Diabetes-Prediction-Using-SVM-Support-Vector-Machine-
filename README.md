# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-SVM-Support-Vector-Machine-

Using Attributes such as fasting blood glucose, HbA1c levels, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and family medical history, the model identifies individuals at risk of diabetes with high accuracy.

üõ†Ô∏è **Tools & Techniques Used:**
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
Data Preprocessing: Label Encoding, Feature Scaling with StandardScaler
Modeling: SVM with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
Evaluation: ROC Curve, AUC Score, Confusion Matrix, Precision/Recall/F1

üìä **Key Results:**
Accuracy: 95.7%
Precision (Diabetic): 97%
Recall (Diabetic): 99%
ROC AUC Score: 0.975
